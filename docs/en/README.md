As you may know, Instagram closed its API in summer 2016. This Python module can do the same things without any effort.

## What is it?

Instabot is a module for the Python language, which not only implements the wrapper over the Instagram API, but also various useful functions, such as "subscribe to the list of people", "like photos by hashtags", "unsubscribe from non-followers" and so on. Instabot is smart enough: [read](/docs/en/Filtration.md), for example, how it filters people on which it is going to subscribe.
